abstract = {This paper investigates a home delivery and installation routing problem with synchronization constraints stemming from a home industry company in China who provides the last-mile delivery of home decoration and furniture. The company first arranges for products to be delivered from door to door, and later the technicians come to perform the installation service for the customers. The products for each customer must be firstly delivered to the customer by a vehicle and then installed by technicians. The objective is to identify the optimal delivery routes of the vehicles and optimal service routes of the technicians so as to minimize the total travel distance of the delivery and service routes. A deep reinforcement learning method in an Encoder-Decoder fashion with multi-head attention mechanism and beam search strategy is developed to solve the problem. To evaluate the designed method, extensive numerical experiments based on real service networks provided by the company are conducted. The results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem, which outperforms some classical strategies, and some meaningful management implications are provided.}

abstract = {Cutting plane methods play a significant role in modern solvers for tackling mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems. Proper selection of cuts would remove infeasible solutions in the early stage, thus largely reducing the computational burden without hurting the solution accuracy. However, the major cut selection approaches heavily rely on heuristics, which strongly depend on the specific problem at hand and thus limit their generalization capability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven and generalizable cut selection approach, named Cut Ranking, in the settings of multiple instance learning. To measure the quality of the candidate cuts, a scoring function, which takes the instance-specific cut features as inputs, is trained and applied in cut ranking and selection. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Compared with commonly used heuristics for cut selection, the learning-based policy has shown to be more effective, and is capable of generalizing over multiple problems with different properties. Cut Ranking has been deployed in an industrial solver for large-scale MIPs. In the online A/B testing of the product planning problems with more than 107 variables and constraints daily, Cut Ranking has achieved the average speedup ratio of 12.42% over the production solver without any accuracy loss of solution.}

abstract = {In this paper, we consider same-day delivery with vehicles and drones. Customers make delivery requests over the course of the day, and the dispatcher dynamically dispatches vehicles and drones to deliver the goods to customers before their delivery deadline. Vehicles can deliver multiple packages in one route but travel relatively slowly due to the urban traffic. Drones travel faster, but they have limited capacity and require charging or battery swaps. To exploit the different strengths of the fleets, we propose a deep Q-learning approach. Our method learns the value of assigning a new customer to either drones or vehicles as well as the option to not offer service at all. In a systematic computational analysis, we show the superiority of our policy compared to benchmark policies and the effectiveness of our deep Q-learning approach. We also show that the combination of state and action features is very valuable and that our policy can maintain effectiveness when demand data and the fleet size change moderately.}

	abstract = {This paper intends to address the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP) with minimizing maximum completion time (makespan). In order to solve this problem, we propose four mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models as well as a constraint programming (CP) model, among which four MILP models are formulated based on four different modeling ideas. MILP models are effective in solving small-scaled problems to optimality. DFJSP is NP-hard, therefore, we propose an efficient constraint programming (CP) model based on interval decision variables and domain filtering algorithms. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed MILP models and CP model. The results show that the sequence-based MILP model is the most efficient one, and the proposed CP model is effective in finding good quality solutions for the both the small-sized and large-sized instances. The CP model incomparably outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and obtains new best solutions for 11 benchmark problems. Moreover, the best MILP model and CP model have proved the optimality of 62 best-known solutions.}
